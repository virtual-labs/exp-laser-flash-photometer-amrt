        "a": "Laser flash photolysis using nanosecond lasers allows study of extremely fast reactions. <a href='https://example.com/laser-flash-photolysis'>More info</a>",
        "b": "Stopped-flow techniques are fast but not as fast as laser-based methods.",
        "c": "NMR is slower, typically used for more stable intermediates.",
        "d": "Spectrophotometry is not suitable for very fast time scales."

        "a": "Light",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "While light is involved, the measurement tracks changes over time.",
        "b": "Intensity may vary but is not the monitored variable.",
        "c": "Correct: changes are measured as a function of time.",
        "d": "Incorrect: there is a variable being trackedâ€”time."
