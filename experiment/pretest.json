        "a": "Laser flash photolysis using nanosecond lasers allows study of extremely fast reactions. <a href='https://example.com/laser-flash-photolysis'>More info</a>",
        "b": "Stopped-flow techniques are fast but not as fast as laser-based methods.",
        "c": "NMR is slower, typically used for more stable intermediates.",

        "a": "While light is involved, the measurement tracks changes over time.",

        "a": "Correct: as per the text, the excited state lasts nanoseconds.",
