        "a": "Correct: as per the text, the excited state lasts nanoseconds.",
        "b": "Too short for this case.",
        "c": "Too long—eximer emissions are faster.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Light is used, but not the dependent variable.",
        "b": "Correct: the product spectrum evolves over time.",
